# SkyTidings

This is a take home coding accessment that had to meet three objectives:

- Use the OpenWeatherMap API for either a zipcode or city name passed in as a parameter.
- Allow the API caller to pass in a query parameter specifying in which unit the temperature should be formatted (i.e. celsius, fahrenheit, or kelvin.
- Format the returned data as a JSON object that includes: coordinates (lon / lat), current conditions (e.g. Cloudy, Sunny, etc), and the current, high, and low temperatures for the current day in the requested unit.

**Technologies Used**
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, ES6, Material-UI, NPM Packages (create-react-app, axios, sweetalert2).
